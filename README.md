# Simple Entry Management Software - Innovacer

### Technologies Used:
* Frontend - HTML/CSS
* Backend - Flask
* Database - MySQL
* APIs - SMTP ( Email ðŸ“§ , Twillio (SMS) )

### Overall Approach towards the problem

The task was to create a Entry Management Software for visitor.
I made the app very simple and easy to understand, using frontend
of HTML/CSS, which provides two option for visitor, that is to 
Check-in or Check-out. Once the user Checks in there's a simple form
which asks for user details and host information. After storing the 
information in MySQL Database, the host is informed about the visitor
through mail and sms. Once the meeting is over, visitor checks out by 
using the check-out option from the web-app.
